Chapter 2
  Shaping is definded as the middleground process between abstract and concrete models. Wireframes 
  cannot be used as they pertain too many details which leave designers no flexibility.
  Words, on the other hand, are too abstract and leave meaning up for interpretaion.

  Shaping stage is meant to be rough outlines done in fat marker sketches. All the elements are not detailed
  but the overall picture is highlighted. Shaping is bounded meaning it gives a clear picture of what not to do.
  In order to desing the shaping process, one must have technical skill and knowlege of requirments. The steps to 
  shaping include : set boundries, rough out the elements, address the risks and rabbit holes,
  and write the pitch.


Chapter 3
  The inital step invloves setting boundries. We have to explicitly define the apetite.
  Essentially this means whetere the developlers will have time to implment the ideas in the given time frame.
  The apetitites come in two sizes, small batch 1 or 2 weeks of work, and big batch, the whole 6 weeks of work.

  Shaping also invloves narrowing down the problem. It could easily take the whole six weeks to develop of feature
  to fix a non existent problem. If the exact problem of the cusotmer is daignosed, the work can dramatically be reduced
  to take 1 or 2 weeks of time.
  

Chapter 4

Moving at the right speed requires the answer to some questions such as 
  Where in the current system does the new thing fit?
  How do you get to it?
  What are the key components or interactions?
  Where does it take you?

A concept called breadboarding is used design at the right level of abstraction. The three things drawn in this 
technique are
Places: These are things you can navigate to, like screens, dialogs, or menus that pop up.
Affordances: These are things the user can act on, like buttons and fields. We consider interface copy to be an affordance, too. Reading it is an act that gives the user information for subsequent actions.
Connection lines: These show how the affordances take the user from place to place.


Chapter 5

This chapter pertains to the risks invloved with using thus methadology. Shaped work looks like a thin-tailed 
probability distribution. The risk in this case is defined as time spent to finish the defined work.
This could dramatically shift the right end of the curve if there are any technical unknowns, called rabbit holes.

In order to find these rabbit holes, we can run through use cases and ask questions such as

Does this require new technical work we’ve never done before?
Are we making assumptions about how the parts fit together?
Are we assuming a design solution exists that we couldn’t come up with ourselves?
Is there a hard decision we should settle in advance so it doesn’t trip up the team?
