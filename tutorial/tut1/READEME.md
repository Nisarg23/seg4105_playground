In software development, the term "PM" can encompass several meanings, each representing a 
critical role and share similar responsibilities. Firstly, "PM" often stands for "Product Manager," 
an individual responsible for defining the product vision, setting priorities, and ensuring that the development 
team is building the right features to meet user needs and business goals. 
On the other hand, "PM" can also refer to "Project Manager," 
(which is the primary definition used in this course) who focuses on the project's execution, 
managing timelines, budgets, and resources to deliver the software on time and within scope. Whilst also in 
communication with the developers and customers. They act as a middleman between the two handling the “interruptions” 
in the development process. 

Furthermore, in some contexts, "PM" may signify "Program Manager," tasked with overseeing a portfolio of 
related projects and aligning them with strategic objectives. These interpretations of "PM" reflect on the nature 
of the software development process and methodologies.
