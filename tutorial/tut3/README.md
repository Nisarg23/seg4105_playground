Notes on Writing a Pitch

- shape up prod development
- what is a pitch?
	- a direction for feature development
	- document about idea
	- rough sketch on first draft ideas on implmentation
- Who writes a pitch
 	- developers, desingers, customers?
- What to include in a pitch?
- purpose of a pitch
- dont always take customer suggested implementations
- solution of pitch may not be execution\
- elements of a pitch
- rabbit holes and tracer bullets

Summary of podcast notes

Essetnially, pitches are directions on where to go with project. Which inlcude low level 
details and rough ideas not full solutions. The elements of a pitch include: 

Problem: Clearly define the problem that needs solving,
Appetite: Set boundaries for how big or small the solution should be,
Solution: Suggest a solution, but not in exhaustive detail,
Rabbit Holes: Identify potential pitfalls or overly complex areas to avoid,
No-Gos: Highlight aspects that are explicitly out of scope.

Anyone on the product team can write a pitch. Ideally they should have some technical knowledge 
to avoid technical pitfalls and have a good idea of time constraints.

Teams use the pitches for a direction to take the project and to work automanously. They can use it to make 
decisions as well as adapt to changes. Pitches need to be created with a balance to providing direction and leaving
ehough detail out for flexibility purposes.

A rabbit hole is essentially going down a patch which seems feasible but afterwards useses too many 
resources without delivering results. Rabbit holes need to be avoided at all costs in order to 
achieve timelines.
